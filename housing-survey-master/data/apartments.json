Apartment buildings were never common in Ann Arbor before World War II and the few that were constructed were built in the 1920s. 322 N. State is constructed in the Tudor Revival style, popular in the 1920s. It has steeply sloping roof lines, half-timbered gables, round arched entries, tapestry brick and the general asymmetry common to the style. The building was constructed in 1928 at the height of the Roaring Twenties and great care was taken to use the best materials and add detail where ever possible: the roof is slate, the expensive accents are pierced brick work, color tiles and sandstone details, and some windows even had canvas awnings.
