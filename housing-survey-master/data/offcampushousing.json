Huron St -- Aug 2013 - 2014)\n \nTestimonial:\n\"I've had an absolutely pleasurable and relaxing time living with Rob as my roommate and landlord. He honors an individual's personal freedom almost religiously and is always eager to please his tenants and roommates beyond reason. Although some might consider it a bit crazy, he does things like buy our house a 62-inch plasma TV and not charge his tenants a cent for it! The gigantic outdoor hot tub is REALLY nice and it's perfect after a hard day's work or in the middle of winter. Rob exemplifies the exact opposite of a lazy or inattentive landlord. He has NEVER once failed to follow through whether it was putting in an air conditioner, letting me renovate the basement for my music equipment, picking me up from the airport, or fixing one of a thousand luxury items we have at our disposal at 1421 W. Huron. Remember that all utilities and internet are included and it's a really good deal especially when Rob incurs huge property taxes and heating bills in the middle of winter. None is passed on. You will not find a landlord more obsessed with the happiness of his\/her tenants than Rob. As a roommate, Rob was always very social and allowed me to have my space when I wanted it.\nMost of the time it is quiet around our house, but we occasionally threw a party or two using the spacious empty double lot next to us and our large basement that has a 1920s bar in it. Rob made it difficult for me to move away because he has spoiled us so much; 1421 W. Huron feels like home for me now.\"\n-- Paul D.\n(Resident 1421 W. Huron St. 2004-2006)\n \nRob is like nobody you have ever met, or will ever meet, in your life. He cares about his housemates\u2019 comfort possibly more than his own. He demonstrates this by regularly asking if we need anything; offering us utensils\/appliances\/gadgets just to make our lives easier; and promptly fixing or replacing anything in the house that doesn\u2019t work. And he does all of this sincerely and energetically. All of these actions, big and small, have had a huge impact on our quality of life during the past four years that we have lived in his house. Beyond Rob\u2019s personal impact on life at 1309 South 7th Street, there are many other reasons to love the place: proximity to the quaint Old West Side neighborhood, walking distance to Pioneer and Eberwhite Woods, off-street parking, in-house free laundry, backyard and garden space.

Huron St. 2004-2006)\n \nRob is like nobody you have ever met, or will ever meet, in your life. He cares about his housemates\u2019 comfort possibly more than his own. He demonstrates this by regularly asking if we need anything; offering us utensils\/appliances\/gadgets just to make our lives easier; and promptly fixing or replacing anything in the house that doesn\u2019t work. And he does all of this sincerely and energetically. All of these actions, big and small, have had a huge impact on our quality of life during the past four years that we have lived in his house.

He honors an individual's personal freedom almost religiously and is always eager to please his tenants and roommates beyond reason.

The gigantic outdoor hot tub is REALLY nice and it's perfect after a hard day's work or in the middle of winter. Rob exemplifies the exact opposite of a lazy or inattentive landlord. He has NEVER once failed to follow through whether it was putting in an air conditioner, letting me renovate the basement for my music equipment, picking me up from the airport, or fixing one of a thousand luxury items we have at our disposal at 1421 W. Huron. Remember that all utilities and internet are included and it's a really good deal especially when Rob incurs huge property taxes and heating bills in the middle of winter. None is passed on.

I'm helping my landlady find new tenants starting spring\/summer 2020 as I will be moving out early May and my housemates early May and mid-June. There are two rooms available for lease (the attic room and the smaller bedroom on the second floor), but three rooms if you want to use the living room as a bedroom as well. Lease is flexible, although the landlady would prefer tenants who plan on leasing for 12 or more months. The landlady also lives in the house on the first floor (different unit) and is super nice and sweet.\nThe house has two-units and is near the intersection of Hill Street and Main Street. It is about a 2 minutes' walk away from an Ann Arbor TheRide bus stop (and a Seven-Eleven if anyone wants a midnight snack), 5 minutes from a UMich Commuter North\/South bus stop, 10 minutes from South Quad, and 15 minutes from East Quad. Close to the Big House (5 minutes??? I've never been there) and the athletic campus. I don't work out so I don't really know, but it probably takes 7-10 minutes to get to the IM building.\nRooms: - are basically fully furnished (there are bed frames and mattresses, bookshelves, dressers, lamps, chairs, etc. that the landlady can provide if needed, but feel free to bring your own; I don't think there are writing desks, not too sure) - have access to a kitchen and bathroom shared only with the other tenants - have access to the basement\/laundry room (accessible through the landlady's unit, to which she will give you a key to freely enter and exit)\nThe smaller of the two rooms is the one the second floor next to the kitchen and living room and diagonally across from the bathroom. It is available starting early May. Rent is $600\/month.\nThe attic room is much larger, and the stairs connect it to the living room on the second floor. It is available starting early May. There is well enough space for two people if you have someone you want to room with! Rent is around $700\/month? (not sure because it's not my room) Obviously the cost will be lower for each person if you share. (maybe $400 for each person?)\nThe living room is on the second floor directly across from the bathroom and can fit a twin\/double bed. One of my housemates currently uses it as her bedroom and will be moving out mid-June. It is slightly inconvenient as the person in the attic would have to pass through the room to go to the bathroom, kitchen, or outside; however, there is a door between the living room and the stairs to the attic and the rent would be lower as well.\nNotes:- price is not set so the listed price is what I believe to be within the landlady\u2019s acceptable range; please contact me if interested so I can set you up with the landlady for further information and a house tour- female tenants only before mid-June when my housemate leaves (at her request)- parking available- no dogs or cats (pets like fish are fine)- absolutely NO smoking or doing drugs in the house- please be respectful of shared spaces (e.g. don't leave unwashed dishes in the sink and on the counters overnight, don't be overly loud in the early morning\/late at night - the house has almost no soundproofing and the landlady is elderly and needs her rest... just be a good and responsible person and the landlady will be happy?)\nPlease message me if interested!","1162":"[ROOMS AVAILABLE STARTING SPRING\/SUMMER 2020]\nHello!

It is about a 2 minutes' walk away from an Ann Arbor TheRide bus stop (and a Seven-Eleven if anyone wants a midnight snack), 5 minutes from a UMich Commuter North\/South bus stop, 10 minutes from South Quad, and 15 minutes from East Quad. Close to the Big House (5 minutes??? I've never been there) and the athletic campus. I don't work out so I don't really know, but it probably takes 7-10 minutes to get to the IM building.\nRooms: - are basically fully furnished (there are bed frames and mattresses, bookshelves, dressers, lamps, chairs, etc. that the landlady can provide if needed, but feel free to bring your own; I don't think there are writing desks, not too sure) - have access to a kitchen and bathroom shared only with the other tenants - have access to the basement\/laundry room (accessible through the landlady's unit, to which she will give you a key to freely enter and exit)\nThe smaller of the two rooms is the one the second floor next to the kitchen and living room and diagonally across from the bathroom. It is available starting early May. Rent is $600\/month.\nThe attic room is much larger, and the stairs connect it to the living room on the second floor. It is available starting early May. There is well enough space for two people if you have someone you want to room with! Rent is around $700\/month? (not sure because it's not my room) Obviously the cost will be lower for each person if you share. (maybe $400 for each person?)\nThe living room is on the second floor directly across from the bathroom and can fit a twin\/double bed. One of my housemates currently uses it as her bedroom and will be moving out mid-June. It is slightly inconvenient as the person in the attic would have to pass through the room to go to the bathroom, kitchen, or outside; however, there is a door between the living room and the stairs to the attic and the rent would be lower as well.\nNotes:- price is not set so the listed price is what I believe to be within the landlady\u2019s acceptable range; please contact me if interested so I can set you up with the landlady for further information and a house tour- female tenants only before mid-June when my housemate leaves (at her request)- parking available- no dogs or cats (pets like fish are fine)- absolutely NO smoking or doing drugs in the house- please be respectful of shared spaces (e.g. don't leave unwashed dishes in the sink and on the counters overnight, don't be overly loud in the early morning\/late at night - the house has almost no soundproofing and the landlady is elderly and needs her rest... just be a good and responsible person and the landlady will be happy?)\nPlease message me if interested!","1169":"[ROOMS AVAILABLE STARTING SPRING\/SUMMER 2020]\nHello!

Our large size gives us lots of common area space. We have not one, but FOUR, count \u2018em, FOUR porches. We have a great location right across from \u201cThe Rock\u201d (not Dwayne Johnson, the UMich Rock.) We have a massive backyard with a fire pit, a hammock, and the glorious ICC Education Center. Even though 49 people live here, (wow!) we have a very strong sense of community. Lutherites are a very close family, a family with daddy issues, but a family nonetheless. We love to have fun, and with so many Lutherites, there\u2019s always something to do. However, since we have two huge houses, it\u2019s still pretty easy to get away from the commotion and find a quiet space. Luther is a very social house, famous for its Lutherween party (our bangin\u2019 Halloween party), Disco Party, and Lutherfest (a musical festival during the summer). Plus, we kick off each semester with an in-house wine and cheese party! If you want to have a good time, and also make some good memories burning a 4ft tall groundhog, Luther\u2019s the home for you.","2251":"Luther House is actually made up of two historic houses that have had a colorful history even before they became ICC co-ops, and by that I mean John Lennon had sex in our house.
